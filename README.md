# 💫 About Me

Hi, I'm **Marcos**, a backend-oriented software developer based in Argentina 🇦🇷.  
I build **data-intensive backend systems** using **Go**, relational databases, and Linux-based infrastructure.

With a background in computer engineering, I focus on hands-on backend work:
**ETL pipelines, data modeling, and systems programming**.

I’m especially interested in:
- High-performance data ingestion & ETL
- Data modeling and schema design
- Clean architecture and long-term maintainability
- Linux-first, open-source tooling
